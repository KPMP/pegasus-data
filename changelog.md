## Release 2.5 (unreleased)
Brief summary of what's in this release:

### Breaking changes
Breaking changes include any database updates needed, if we need to edit any files on system (like .env or certs, etc). Things that are outside of the code itself that need changed for the system to work.

### Non-breaking changes
Just a place to keep track of things that have changed in the code that we may want to pay special attention to when smoke testing, etc.
